Nathyu is a browser start page. I made a feel of them for my `rices`, but this should be the last one. It has a nice appearence and is pretty easy to customize. Here is some things you can change:

-   Colorschemes
-   Search engines
-   Bookmarks
-   Some screen elements

The configuration is saved on localstorage, but can be exported as `json` and later imported.

# How to use

I'm still figuring out.
